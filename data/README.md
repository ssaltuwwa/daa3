# Transportation Network Optimization - Minimum Spanning Tree

University assignment implementing Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for city transportation network optimization.

## 📋 Project Description
Finding the minimum set of roads that connect all city districts with the lowest possible total construction cost using MST algorithms.

## 🚀 Algorithms
- **Prim's Algorithm** - O(E log V) with binary heap
- **Kruskal's Algorithm** - O(E log E) with union-find

- Operation counting
- Execution time measurement
- Performance comparison
